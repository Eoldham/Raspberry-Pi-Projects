# Raspberry-Pi-Projects

## About: 
This is three different projects I wrote in C that were run on the raspberry pi. I use the sense hat to display images. Each Folder has a different project: 
### 6 Dice Roll
This program rolls 6 6-sided dice and displays the dice on the screen. You can change the colors between blue, green and red by pressing the joystick and to roll the six dice you must shake the pi. 
### Binary Clock
This file is supposed to take the time from the users computer then conver it to binary and put it out to the raspberry pi screen. Blue is for hours, green is for minutes and red is for seconds. 
### Initials on Pi
This project displays my initials "EO" on the Pi, I just made certain coordinates blank and certain ones lit up so that the initals are drawn.
